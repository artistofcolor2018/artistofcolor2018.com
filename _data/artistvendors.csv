Vessna Scheff,/img/artistvendor/vessna.png,"Vessna Scheff -to being bold, brave & full of color Through my art, I reclaim who I am, what I have to say, and how I want to say it. Art, has always been my space of freedom. Art allows me to be as big, loud and powerful as I want to be- to encourage others to live boldly, challenge structures, and create experiences that connect across boundaries. Freedom in art for me involves learning to recognize disenfranchisement, detaching its weight from my shoulders, to let it be carried by collective struggle. I am inspired by stories of resilience and revolution, in particular by Malcolm X, Assata Shakur and Angela Davis. The freedom I achieve through creating comes from my passion for beauty and the power of people. Using a combination of watercolors on wood, watercolor on Dura-lar, poetry, movement and voice, I orchestrate performances where we may challenge our fears, craft our freedom and nurture our empowerment. Listen for a taste- a song about being bold in your decisions despite what others might pressure you to believe. You got this:: Good By Me Love, Vessna"
