Vessna Scheff,/img/artistvendor/vessna.png,"Vessna Scheff -to being bold, brave & full of color Through my art, I reclaim who I am, what I have to say, and how I want to say it. Art, has always been my space of freedom. Art allows me to be as big, loud and powerful as I want to be- to encourage others to live boldly, challenge structures, and create experiences that connect across boundaries. Freedom in art for me involves learning to recognize disenfranchisement, detaching its weight from my shoulders, to let it be carried by collective struggle. I am inspired by stories of resilience and revolution, in particular by Malcolm X, Assata Shakur and Angela Davis. The freedom I achieve through creating comes from my passion for beauty and the power of people. Using a combination of watercolors on wood, watercolor on Dura-lar, poetry, movement and voice, I orchestrate performances where we may challenge our fears, craft our freedom and nurture our empowerment. Listen for a taste- a song about being bold in your decisions despite what others might pressure you to believe. You got this:: Good By Me Love, Vessna"

Thawra,/img/artistvendor/tj.jpg,“Inspired by my Palestinian heritage on my father's side of the family and my indigenous Muscogee-Creek heritage on my mother's side, I have been fascinated by handmade jewelry and revolutionary art for years. In the past, I’ve worked mostly with beads and wire. As of now, most of my jewelry is made with polymer clay and acrylic paint, but I switch up my medium any time new ideas come to mind. On both sides of my family, jewelry has been our way of expressing our cultural pride and identity. It has also been used as a tool to heal us of our historical wounds. I believe that the only way to overcome these wounds is to pick up the broken pieces and shape them into positive energy that I can share with the world, hence the four words I regularly draw on the back of each of my pieces: Dream, Freedom, Revolution, and Love.

Manny Archo,/img/artistvendor/manny.jpg, “Manny Arocho is more than your average musician, but a manipulator of sound and harmony. Born and raised in Hunting Park, a multicultural North Philadelphia neighborhood, Manny grew up around many influences. Within these influences, he found a love for many styles of music from Salsa and Merengue, to Hip-hop and Heavy Metal. When the opportunity presented itself to pick up an instrument to learn, Manny wasted no time and quickly fell in love with the bass. Since then, he has been constructing a sound on the bass that cuts through the atmosphere while still remaining grounded in the mystic low-end. Since 2015 Manny has played with a number of music groups such as AveNoir, Izzy Project, Papo Gely, BLK MGC, Wolf Cat, and GCF Praise n’ Worship band to name a few. In just the past few years Manny's main focus shifted from bass to production when he grew a love for beat making, it was something about having full control of a sound that made him so intrigued. Releasing music under the moniker “mannyroach”, which is a conjunction of his first and last name, Manny has made a sound that is true to his adoration for groove, bass, and sonics. Manny wishes to connect with other artists from diverse backgrounds, facets, and cultures by providing a space in which the atmosphere helps people feel safe to express.

Henry Zhang,/img/artistvendor/hen.jpg, “Hailing from the Hospitality state, wandering through DC for 4 years, and finally arriving in Philly to attend Uarts, the 25 year life journey of Manchurian-American and musician of color Henry Zhang has culminated into several projects and concert series during his time here. Born and raised in Starkville, MS for 16 years, he started on violin at the age of 9 and over the course of 10 years, was part of several orchestral organizations, with the highlight of performing Beethoven’s 6th Symphony in full with the DC Youth Orchestra at the White House in April 2010. During this decade of rigid classical training, he found the guitar and, with the newly discovered love for improvisation and the freedom of expression that came with it, decided to pursue the instrument, initially latching onto Delta Blues. Relocating to the nation’s capital came with it the pursuit of new styles and there was no greater influence than that of jazz and progressive music. It is true what they say of cities and how their sounds are influenced by its environment. Mississippi’s slow way of life taught him the patience of the blues; DC’s pressured, fast-lane lifestyle taught him the how to keep up with the race; but Philly, being right in the middle of pace, taught him how to groove through the city’s famous Neo-soul sound and scene. In the past 4 years of living and creating in Philadelphia, Henry has been the guitarist for a plethora of artists in all parts of the city, including his own projects of neo-jazz substance; for multiple churches of Baptist and NonDenom types; as well as professional jazz combos and corporate gig groups. He has performed at venues as humble as the Beaverdam House at Temple University and as prestigious as the Barnes Foundation. He plans to continue his work in Philadelphia as well as expand to other major cities, in due time. He has an affinity for irregularly sized objects, such as giant spoons or tiny burritos for hamsters.”
