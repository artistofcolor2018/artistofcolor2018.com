<h2>About</h2>

<br>

<p>A Day in the Life of an Artist of Color began with Drain Ourselves, a poem by Becca Khalil. Drain Ourselves addresses the tokenization, fetishization, and subsequent white washing Becca has experienced as a performer in the Philadelphia theatre community. After sharing the poem and seeing how it resonated with friends and artists, Becca was inspired to start a project that brought together Artists of Color to further share their experiences with each other and the Philadelphia arts community.</p>

<br>

<p>A Day in the Life of an Artist of Color is an ongoing project that brings together Artists of Color in Philadelphia through the curation of both digital and physical spaces. It consists of three phases: a series of social media spotlights, social mixers, and collaborative photo series (Phase 1); a film project featuring materials from selected artists developed in the previous phase (Phase 2); and a live multimedia performance centered around the film (Phase 3).</p>

<p>Each part is purposefully designed to highlight Artists of Color in Philadelphia and showcase their work on their own terms. To create this project we are bringing together musicians, performers, dancers, craft-people, poets, filmmakers, and more to create a community that truly reflects the plurality of our experiences.</p>
